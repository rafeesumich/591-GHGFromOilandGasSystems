    "The purpose of this project is to examine established Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions data\n",
    "and determine if there is a correlation between accelerated hydrocarbon (Crude oil and Natural\n",
    "gas) production through horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing in the most recent decade\n",
    "and GHG emissions rates. If a correlation is found, additional analysis may be able to reveal the\n",

    "The analysis of this project is likely to create more questions than answers. The primary reason for this is that energy production, usage, and the associated emissions is a very complicated environment with many moving parts. While some component factors may be increasing in usage or emissions, others may be seeing improvements in efficiency and utilization."
