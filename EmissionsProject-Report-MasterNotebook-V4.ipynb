    "## Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions from Upstream and Midstream US Oil and Gas Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "By Rafee Shaik and Greg Myers  \n",
    "April-May 2020\n",
    "<a id='overview'></a>\n",
    "## Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The Oil and Natural Gas industry consists of three sectors, the **Upstream** sector that focuses on Exploring and Producing (E&P) Hydrocarbons, the **Midstream** sector focuses on Transportation and storage facilities, and the **Downstream** sector will process and refine raw materials such as crude oil into consumer products like gasoline.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enhanced hydrocarbon extraction methods, that include horizontal drilling and fracking boosted Crude Oil and Natural Gas Production in the US since 2007. The purpose of this project is to examine Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions from upstream and midstream sectors of the industry and determine if there is a correlation between accelerated hydrocarbon (Crude oil and Natural gas) production in the most recent decade and GHG emissions rates. If a correlation is found, additional analysis may be able to reveal the causal source. The project will focus on three GHGs, Carbon-Dioxide (CO2), Methane (CH4), and Nitrous Oxide (N2O).\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='motivation'></a>\n",
    "## Project Motivation\n",
    "There has been an increase in US hydrocarbons production since the shale boom that started in 2007/2008 ![Fig-0](./HistoricalProduction.png) Hydrocarbon production in the US increased steadily since then, this increase in production led to an increase in GHG emissions from Upstream and Midstream operations of Oil and Gas companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is in every stakeholder's interest to control these emissions while optimizing the production. These stakeholders include the operating company, environmental protection agencies, and local and federal governments. The goal of the study is to find any correlation between increased hydrocarbon production and industry sector GHG emissions? Does the correlation apply to the industry as a whole or one or more individual components? This study can also lead to identifying the opportunities to improve the pipeline infrastructure and invest in pneumatic devices that can detect and prevent hydrocarbon emissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both the project team members work in the Oil and Gas industry and are intrigued to find opportunities to reduce GHG emissions while optimizing the production.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='DataSources'></a>\n",

    "## Data Manipulation Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='ProcessEmissionData'></a>\n",
    "### Processing Emissions Data\n",
    "#### Data Acquisition:\n",
    "1. Data that was downloaded from EPA is in Excel spreadsheet format.\n",
    "2. EPA Emission reports are separated by the industry sector (upstream and midstream) and GHG gas type (CO2, CH4, and N2O). All together we have 6 Excel spreadsheets.\n",
    "3. Within each Excel file we have multiple worksheets, a separate worksheet for each reporting year, starting from 2011 to 2018.  \n",
    "[Go to the code](EmissionsDataPreparation.ipynb/#ProcessEmissionsData)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Parsing Excel spreadsheets:\n",
    "* Pandas’ **read_excel** module was used in parsing excel spreadsheets. Read_excel module can read multiple worksheets present in excel file. The option **\"sheet_name=’null’\"** was used to read all sheets from the excel files. Read_excel() returns a named dictionary containing worksheet name as key and corresponding data in a dataframe as dictionary value.  \n",
    "* Iterate through each data frame in the dictionary, add three columns, 1. reporting_year with the value from dictionary key, 2. GHG Gas type with the value from part of the source file name, and 3. Industry sector with the value from part of the source file name.  \n",
    "* Do the same for all six excel spreadsheets.  \n",
    "* Combine all dataframes into a single dataframe using **pandas.concat()** method.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Processing the data:\n",
    "1. Each row represents a facility operated under single company ownership or joint venture between multiple companies. So we need to separate the joint ventures and create a row for each company, and then calculate their portion of emission based on joint venture percentages.  \n",
    "For example:  \n",
    "```python\n",
    "    \"SHELL OIL CO (51.8%); EXXONMOBIL CORP (48.2%)\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "2. Joint ventures are seperated by semicoluns (;), \".str.split(';')\" method will separate the joint venture companies and will give us a list containing companies and their portion of GHG emission contribution.  \n",
    "3. Melt this single row into multiple rows that represent a separate row for each partner company. Apply the **‘explode’** method on Joint venture company list to separate the individual companies.  \n",
    "4. We use regular expressions to parse out the company name and partnership percentages into separate columns.  \n",
    "5. Here is the regular expression used to parse the company names and partnership percentages:  \n",
    "```python\n",
    "\tregex=r'(?P<PARENT_COMPANY>[-\\w\\s\\d,&./()#]+)([\\(])(?P<CONTRIBUTION>[\\(\\d.]+)([%\\)]*)'\n",
    "```\n",
    "6. Convert partnership percentage and emission quantity from text type to numeric type.  \n",
    "7. Replace non-numeric values with zero ‘0’\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Aggregation:\n",
    "We applied different levels of aggregations in our analysis. Data has attributes representing Company Name, Reporting Year, Gas type, and Industry sector.\n",
    "1. GHG Gas type analysis: Data were separated by GHG gas type (CO2, CH4, and N2O), all these emission quantities are represented in CO2 equivalents. We will sum them up by the Company and Gas type within the reporting year to compare the emissions of different gas types.\n",
    "2. Company level emissions: Each company can operate multiple facilities across the US, we will sum the emissions from the facilities operated by the same company within a reporting year. This data will be used to compare the emissions from different companies over the period of time.\n",
    "3. Sector level emissions: Data will be aggregated by the industry sector within the reporting year.\n",
    "4. Yearly GHG emissions: We will sum up the emissions from all companies, sectors, and gas types within the reporting year\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Joining Emissions data with other datasets:\n",
    "Reporting_year is be used as joining key when joining Emissions dataset with other datasets in the analysis such as Yearly Crude Oil and Natural Gas Production and Emissions from other Industries.  \n",
    "[Go to the code](EmissionsDataPreparation.ipynb/#Join_Prod_n_Emission)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Challenges:\n",
    "Over the period of time companies report their emissions with different names, like ‘Conoco Phillips’, ‘ConocoPhillips’, ‘ConocoPhillips Company’ all these company names represent one company ‘ConocoPhillips’. We used a third-party library ‘cleanco’ to clean up the company names, this library helped to remove the company type suffixes, like ‘LLC’, ‘Co’, etc. We performed company name lookup to standardize the company names. We put these company name lookup table in a [CSV file](./CompanyName_Lookup.csv).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Saving aggregated data for Analysis and visualizations:\n",
    "Aggregated emissions data will be saved in ['Emissions_aggregatedData.csv'](Emissions_aggregatedData.csv) CSV file\n",
    "\n",
    "<a id='ProcessProductionData'></a>\n",
    "### Processing Crude and Natural Gas Production volumes datasets\n",
    "1. Save API query results to a JSON file as an immutable source data reference.\n",
    "2. Import JSON data (crude & gas) into Pandas data frames.\n",
    "3. Perform Explode operations to separate date and production data.\n",
    "4. Transform Date column into a DateTime data type.\n",
    "5. Create and populate a product type column and drop unused columns.\n",
    "6. Append crude and gas data frames (long-format).\n",
    "7. Save the data frame to a CSV file with the name ['Processed_AnnualProductionData.csv'](Processed_AnnualProductionData.csv) for analysis and visualizations.  \n",

    "2. Download the data in CSV format and save it to 'IndustryWiseGHGEmissions.csv' file.\n",
    "3. Data is present in wide format, one row for each industry and emission values in seperate columns from 2011 to 2018.\n",
    "4. use the Pandas **melt** function to convert the wide format to long format.\n",
    "5. Filter out the yearly total values from the dataset\n",
    "6. Fill non-numeric values with zero '0'\n",

    "\n",
    "### Correlation between Hydrocarbons production and GHG emissions\n",
    "The focus of the analysis is studying the impact of increased Hydrocarbons production on Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions from the Oil & Gas industry.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To perform this analysis we joined the annual Oil and Natural Gas Production data from EIA (Energy Information Administration, EIA.gov) with annual GHG emissions data from EPA (Environment Protection Agency EPA.gov). These datasets were joined by the Reporting Year as key. The processed and merged dataset was saved in ['ProductionVsEmissionSplit.csv'](ProductionVsEmissionSplit.csv) file. We used this merged dataset for our analysis and visualizations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We plotted annual production and emissions volumes on a timeseries line chart to observe the trend in GHG Emissions and Hydrocarbon productions between the years 2011 and 2018.  \n",
    "![Combined Hydrocarbon Production vs Combined GHG Emission volumes](ProductionVsEmission.JPG)  \n",
    "We observed both GHG Emissions and Hydrocarbon Production volumes are on increasing trend between 2011 and 2018.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For a better understanding of GHG Emissions from different Oil & Gas sectors we did a deeper analysis by comparing GHG emissions from individual Oil & Gas sectors (Upstream and Midstream) and different hydrocarbon products (Crude Oil and Natural Gas).\n",
    "![Product wise and Sector wise Production vs Emission volumes](ProdVsEmissionSecWise.JPG)  \n",
    "\n",
    "To understand how strong the correlation between sector-wise GHG emissions and individual product production volumes we calculated Pearson-r between GHG Emissions from different sectors and different hydrocarbon product production volumes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We observed a strong-to-very strong correlation between all hyderocarbon productions and all GHG  sector emissions. Particularly we observed the highest correlation between ‘Natural Gas Production’ and ‘Combined GHG Emission.  \n",

    "### Linear regression -  Predicting future emissions:\n",
    "**Feature selection:**  \n",
    "From the above Pearson-r calculations we observed there is a strong correlation between annual Natural Gas Production volume and annual GHG Emission volume. We will use ‘Natural Gas Production’ as our independent variable (single feature) to predict the GHG Emission volume for year 2019.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Since we have only 8 data points, we will use all the datapoints to train our linear regression model.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Refer to the Liner regression code module [here](./EmissionsProject-Visualizations-2.ipynb/#linearRegress).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Our linear regression model predicted 337.62 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent GHG emissions for the year 2019.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Predicted 2019 GHG emissions are plotted on timeseries chart below  \n",
    "![2019 Predicted Emission](./PredictedEmission.JPG)\n",
    "\n",
    "### A deep dive into sector-wise GHG emissions and Revising regression model:\n",
    "For a deeper GHG emissions analysis we examine the emissions from individual sectors and GHG gas types. We observed a big jump in Midstream GHG emissions in 2016. \n",
    "![Subplots showing annual Emissions by sector, by Gas Type and Number of Operators from each sector](subplots.JPG)  \n",
    "[Go to chart code](EmissionsProject-Visualizations-2.ipynb/#Fig-6)  \n",
    "  \n",
    "This jump in GHG emissions was not expected while the energy industry was in a downturn between 2015 and 2016. After talking to a few Business Analysts and reviewing all the changes in GHG emissions reporting rules from EPA between 2015 and 2016 we noticed EPA introduced a new rule in October 2015 (Docket ID No. EPA–HQ–OAR–2014–0831, https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2015-10-22/pdf/2015-25840.pdf) that require Oil and Gas companies to report GHG emissions from their ‘Gathering and Boosting’ operations. GHG emissions from Gathering and Boosting were not reported in the past. The new rule requires the operators to report these emissions under the midstream sector.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We also observed GHG emissions from ‘Gathering and Boosting’ operations are high and contributing a significant proportion to overall midstream emissions, they were 80.6, 74.12 and 81.28 million metric tons of CO2e in 2016, 2017 and 2018 respectively. That is about 40 to 50% of total annual midstream emissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Revision of the regression model:\n",
    "\n",
    "Since ‘Gathering and Boosting’ added a significant amount of GHG emission to midstream emissions we wanted to revisit our earlier analysis and make adjustments to midstream emissions prier to 2016 EPA rule changes. We added a constant 74.12 million tons of CO2e (minimum amount of GHG emissions from Gathering and Boosting since 2016) to midstream emissions between 2011 and 2015.\n",
    "We recalculated the correlation coefficient (Pearson-r) and observed a positive correlation between Natural Gas Production and combined GHG emission, however, Pearson-r value was down to 0.66 from 0.87.\n",
    "We retrained our linear regression model using adjusted emissions data and recalculated estimated 2019 combined GHG emission quantity. The estimated GHG emission value for 2019 is 290 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent, which is 47.62 million metric tons less than our earlier estimation before adjusting the data for new EPA rule.  \n",
    "[Follow the recalculation and visualization here](EmissionsProject-Visualizations-2.ipynb/#adjustEmission)\n",
    " \n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "**This correlation coefficient value (Pearson-r) may conclude that there is a strong correlation between Natural Gas Production and overall GHG emissions. Since we have only 8 years of data we will be cautious to conclude there is a causal relationship between Natural Gas Production and GHG emissions.**  \n",

    "## A Summery of Analysis and Visualizations:\n",

    "2. Better code management: even though we used github for team coding we were working on the master branch which cause code overwrite towards the end of the project. We should have created individual branches and avoided overwriting the code.\n",
    "3. Bokeh seems to a popular visualization library amount data scientists. We will try to use Bokeh in future projects.\n"
