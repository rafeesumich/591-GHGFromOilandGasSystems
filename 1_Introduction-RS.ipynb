    "* The purpose of this project is to examine established Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions data and determine if there is a correlation between accelerated hydrocarbon (Crude oil and Natural gas) production through horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing in the most recent decade and GHG emissions rates.  \n",
    "* If a correlation is found, additional analysis may be able to reveal the causal source. The project will focus on three GHGs, Carbon-Dioxide (CO2), Methane (CH4), and Nitrous-Oxide (N2O).  \n",

    "## Project Motivation: \n",
    "There has been an increase in US hydrocarbons production since the shale boom that started in 2007/2008 (Fig-1). US hydrocarbon production in the US increased steadily since then, this increase in production led to an increase in GHG emissions from Upstream and Midstream operations of Oil and Gas companies.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It is in every stakeholder's interest to control these emissions while optimizing the production. These stakeholders include the operating company, environmental protection agencies, and local and federal governments.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the study is to find any correlation between increased hydrocarbon production and industry sector GHG emissions? Does the correlation apply to the industry as a whole or one or more individual components?  \n",
    "\n",
    "This study can also lead to identifying the opportunities to improve the pipeline infrastructure and invest in pneumatic devices that can detect and prevent hydrocarbon emissions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Both the project team members work in the Oil and Gas industry and are intrigued to find opportunities to reduce GHG emissions while optimizing the production.  \n",

In addition to the data collection process Gregory has also contributed the following to the project: historical production and GHG concentration visualizations, production versus sector emissions, and industry top GHG emitters visualizations. Finally preparation of the skeletal layout of the JupyterLab notebook presentation which will also receive significant contribution from Rafee Shaik.  \n",
