    "## Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions from Upstream and Midstream US Oil and Gas Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "By Rafee Shaik and Greg Myers  \n",
    "April-May 2020\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Oil and Natural Gas industry consists of three sectors, the **Upstream** sector that focuses on Exploring and Producing (E&P) Hydrocarbons, the **Midstream** sector focuses on Transportation and storage facilities, and the **Downstream** sector will process and refine raw materials such as crude oil into consumer products like gasoline.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enhanced hydrocarbon extraction methods, that include horizontal drilling and fracking boosted Crude Oil and Natural Gas Production in the US since 2007. The purpose of this project is to examine Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions from upstream and midstream sectors of the industry and determine if there is a correlation between accelerated hydrocarbon (Crude oil and Natural gas) production in the most recent decade and GHG emissions rates. If a correlation is found, additional analysis may be able to reveal the causal source. The project will focus on three GHGs, Carbon-Dioxide (CO2), Methane (CH4), and Nitrous Oxide (N2O).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Motivation:\n",
    "There has been an increase in US hydrocarbons production since the shale boom that started in 2007/2008 [Fig-0](./EmissionsProject-Visualizations.ipynb). Hydrocarbon production in the US increased steadily since then, this increase in production led to an increase in GHG emissions from Upstream and Midstream operations of Oil and Gas companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is in every stakeholder's interest to control these emissions while optimizing the production. These stakeholders include the operating company, environmental protection agencies, and local and federal governments. The goal of the study is to find any correlation between increased hydrocarbon production and industry sector GHG emissions? Does the correlation apply to the industry as a whole or one or more individual components? This study can also lead to identifying the opportunities to improve the pipeline infrastructure and invest in pneumatic devices that can detect and prevent hydrocarbon emissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both the project team members work in the Oil and Gas industry and are intrigued to find opportunities to reduce GHG emissions while optimizing the production.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Sources:\n",
    "1. **Greenhouse Gas Emissions Data**\n",
    "**Source:** US Oil and Gas Upstream (Exploration & Production) and Midstream (Pipelines and Storage) facilities can be accessed from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) FLIGHT database.  \n",
    "**Location:** https://ghgdata.epa.gov/ghgp/main.do  \n",
    "**Access Method:** Facility Level Information on GreenHouse gases Tool (FLIGHT) database can be accessed through the website: https://ghgdata.epa.gov/ghgp/main.do.  \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Manipulation Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Processing Emissions Data:\n",
    "#### Data Acquisition:\n",
    "1. Data that was downloaded from EPA is in Excel spreadsheet format.\n",
    "2. EPA Emission reports are separated by the industry sector (upstream and midstream) and GHG gas type (CO2, CH4, and N2O). All together we have 6 excel spreadsheets.\n",
    "3. Within each excel we have a separate worksheet for each reporting year, starting from 2011 to 2018.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Parsing Excel spreadsheets:\n",
    "* Pandas’ **read_excel** module is useful in parsing excel spreadsheets. Read_excel module can read multiple worksheets within an excel book. The option **\"sheet_name=’null’\"** is useful to read all sheets from an excel. Read_excel() returns a named dictionary containing worksheet name as key and corresponding data in a dataframe as value.  \n",
    "* Iterate through each data frame in the dictionary, add three columns, 1. reporting_year with the value from dictionary key, 2. GHG Gas type with the value from part of the source file name, and 3. Industry sector with the value from part of the source file name.  \n",
    "* Do the same for all six excel spreadsheets.  \n",
    "* Combine all dataframes into a single dataframe using **pandas.concat()** method.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Processing the data:\n",
    "Each row represents a facility operated under single company ownership or joint venture between multiple companies. So we need to separate the joint ventures and create a row for each company, calculate their portion of emission based on joint venture percentages.\n",
    "We use regular expressions to parse out the company name and partnership percentages into separate columns. For example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    \"SHELL OIL CO (51.8%); EXXONMOBIL CORP (48.2%)\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here is the regular expression used to parse the company names and partnership percentages:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\tregex=r'(?P<PARENT_COMPANY>[-\\w\\s\\d,&./()#]+)([\\(])(?P<CONTRIBUTION>[\\(\\d.]+)([%\\)]*)'\n",
    "```\n",
    "Melt this single row into multiple rows that represent a separate row for each partner company. Use the method **‘explode’** to separate the individual companies.  \n",
    "Convert partnership percentage and emission quantity from text type to numeric type.  \n",
    "Replace non-numeric values with zero ‘0’\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Aggregation:\n",
    "We applied different levels of aggregations in our analysis. Data has attributes representing Company Name, Reporting Year, Gas type, and Industry sector.\n",
    "1. GHG Gas type analysis: Data were separated by GHG gas type (CO2, CH4, and N2O), all these emission quantities are represented in CO2 equivalents. We will sum them up by the Company and Gas type within the reporting year to compare the emissions of different gas types.\n",
    "2. Company level emissions: Each company can operate multiple facilities across the US, we will sum the emissions from the facilities operated by the same company within a reporting year. This data will be used to compare the emissions from different companies over the period of time.\n",
    "3. Sector level emissions: Data will be aggregated by the industry sector within the reporting year.\n",
    "4. Yearly GHG emissions: We will sum up the emissions from all companies, sectors, and gas types within the reporting year\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Joining Emissions data with other datasets:\n",
    "Reporting_year is be used as joining key when joining Emissions dataset with other datasets in the analysis such as Yearly Crude Oil and Natural Gas Production and Emissions from other Industries.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Challenges:\n",
    "Over the period of time companies report their emissions with different names, like ‘Conoco Phillips’, ‘ConocoPhillips’, ‘ConocoPhillips Company’ all these company names represent one company ‘ConocoPhillips’. We used a third-party library ‘cleanco’ to clean up the company names, this library helped to remove the company type suffixes, like ‘LLC’, ‘Co’, etc. We performed company name lookup to standardize the company names. We put these company name lookup table in a CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Saving aggregated data for Analysis and visualizations:\n",
    "Aggregated emissions data will be saved in 'Emissions_aggregatedData.csv' CSV file\n",
    "\n",
    "### Processing Crude and Natural Gas Production volumes datasets:\n",
    "1. Save API query results to a JSON file as an immutable source data reference.\n",
    "1. Import JSON data (crude & gas) into Pandas data frames.\n",
    "1. Perform Explode operations to separate date and production data.\n",
    "1. Transform Date column into a DateTime data type.\n",
    "1. Create and populate a product type column and drop unused columns.\n",
    "1. Append crude and gas data frames (long-format).\n",
    "1. Save the data frame to a CSV file with the name 'Processed_AnnualProductionData.csv' for analysis and visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Processing GHG Emissions from Other industries:\n",
    "Data is present in wide-format, unpivot the data to put it in long-format, use pandas melt method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Integration:\n",
    "Combine the above two datasets (Emissions and Production volumes) by the Reporting year, with this combined dataset we can compare greenhouse gas emission volumes with Crude Oil and Natural Gas production volumes. Joined dataset is saved in a CSV file with name 'ProductionVsEmissionSplit.csv'\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analysis and Visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary of visualizations:\n",
    "\n",
    "We prepared a linear regression model between between Hydrocarbon production and GHG emission volumes; We will use this model to estimate the future emissions based on production volume\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we genearted several visualizations, most of them are time-series line+scatter plots. We also produced a histogram and Summary table.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Visualization Technique:\n",
    "We used graph_objs library from plotly for all visualizations in this analysis.\n",
    "* Most of our plots are scatter plots with line marks over time-series data.\n",
    "* We used ipywidgets to add interactivity with the charts.\n",
